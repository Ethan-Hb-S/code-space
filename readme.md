**Project - [Full-Stack Student Learning Management System]**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    - **Description**: A highly available and scalable Learning Management System based on cloud, integrating complex and advanced features to streamline user interaction and data management  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    - **Technologies Used**: Python, Javascript, React, Flask, PostgreSQL, RDS, SQS  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    - **Highlights**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Architected and implemented read-write separation on PostgreSQL RDS, leveraging master-slave replication and read replicas to support high-concurrency reads. This resulted in a 30% increase in system throughput and a 20% reduction in response time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Designed and developed REST APIs with Flask to support system functionalities, and integrated the backend with RDS using psycopg2, ensuring the maintainability, scalability, and compatibility of system APIs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Decoupled the frontend and backend by integrating Amazon SQS, enabling asynchronous messaging, reliable communication, and higher throughput of traffic.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Independently developed key features with Javascript, such as course enrollment, timed quizzes, assignment issuance, and a chat forum with notifications, which significantly enhanced usability and interactivity between users.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Collaborated with a team to integrate core functionalities, such as account management via Google Auth API, online streaming with Zoom, and a Dialogflow-powered chatbot, enhancing user engagement and platform interaction.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;    - **Demo**: NA anymore.  
etc.
