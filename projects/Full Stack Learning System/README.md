## Applied Users
Technically, the users can be students/lecturers, meanwhile there will be a system administrator if there doesn't exist one and admin can be multiple.
They are listed below, based on their roles' permission to the system from high to low:<br>
    - administrator: all access and permissions to everything including user accounts<br>
    - lecturer: most of permissions and nearly all access to content such as creating assessment<br>
    - student: limited access and permissions, for example cannot see the certain content before its release date<br>
The majority of features are meant to be developed for students and lecturers, so descriptions below will be in their sight mostly.<br>

## Features


## Installation
### *please notice that its an out-dated installation guide which will not work anymore, since the cloud database server deployed has been disabled*<br>
## Needed files
In the backend directoy create a:
- config.py
- serviceAccKey.json

Copy the data from the Project report into each respective file.

## Install Backend
Go to the directory files located and run the backend_install script. Enter 'lubuntu' as the password if required.
```
sudo sh backend_install.sh
```

While the script is running the psql terminal will appear a few times. You will need to enter the following in the EXACT order. \
First time the psql terminal appears type:
```
alter user postgres password 'lubuntu';
```
Then type 
```
\q
```
Second time the psql terminal appears: \
When prompted for password enter 'lubuntu' (without the ' ') \
Then setup the database by typing: 
```
create database yellow_frogs;
```
Then type 
```
\q
```
The app.py will then begin. KEEP THIS TERMINAL WINDOW AS IS and do the front end setup in a new terminal  window.

## Install Frontend
Go the the 3900w11ayellowfrogs directory
```
cd 3900w11ayellowfrogs
```

Ensure this is a new terminal window and the app.py server is still running.
Run the frontend_install script. Enter 'lubuntu' as the password if required.
```
sudo sh frontend_install.sh
```

To access the web-app use the link generated by the Frontend script.
